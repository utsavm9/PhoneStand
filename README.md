# PhoneStand
Face-tracking Phone Stand using Arduino, ESP32 and cameras.

We wanted to create a phone stand which rotates to keep the userâ€™s face at the center of the screen.

# Hardware
* [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers)
* [ESP32-DEVKITC-32D](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/1965-1000-ND/9356990?itemSeq=375828193)
* [ESP32-CAM WiFi](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T2RYTJF)
* [Stepper Motor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0787BQ4WH)
* [Stepper Motor Driver](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BND65C8/)

We found that [OmniVision OV7670](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S66Y3ZQ) camera module had too low frame rate when used with Arduino Nano.
